    <h1>🥐Croissant</h1>

    <p>A croissant is a French pastry made from a laminated yeast dough, which gives it a flaky and buttery texture. It
        is
        inspired by the Austrian kipferl and is known for its crescent shape. Croissants are typically light, airy, and
        have a
        deeply caramelized buttery flavor, making them a popular choice for breakfast or as a snack. If you're
        interested in
        making croissants, there are many recipes available that guide you through the process of creating this
        delicious
        pastry.</p>
